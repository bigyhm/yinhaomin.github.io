For a long time, when I work hard and sleep less at night, and at the time when getting up next morning, it feels so damn tired, lassitude and sleepy. It is virtal for me as a engineer and manager to keep sober-minded and have a swift response.So I am thinking and seeking, why is this? And I found out, it is all about eating and sleeping.<br>

I tried this:<br>
1.Eat less at supper even if I felt hungry.<br>
This saves me a lot of energy for digest food and felt less tird and sleepy.<br>
2.Sleep as earlier as I can.<br>
This gurantees me more time for sleep if I have to get up earlier next morning.<br>

You can have a try on this. Tell me what you get by comment beside.
